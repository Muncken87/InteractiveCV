          <blockquote><p>I mentored Alexander in his CareerFoundry course, he was very talented, throughout the course, he kept searching for any problem he ran into, and he was very self reliant, his project was perfect in both design and code.</p>

          <p>His progress and learning curve were both perfect. Every task he was supposed to do was having some extra work by him, as he paid great attention to details and to making the overall work mature enough, not just to be a student work.</p>

          <p>Also his motivation for learning web development was great, he was always ahead of the course, and he finished it in a good time. I never needed to contact him for his progress, or ask him to do more, he was doing more than of the course projects, as he did some side projects as well.</p>

          <p>Actually his course projects can be compared to projects from professional software houses that have professional developers.
          I definitely recommend Alexander as a web developer as he is a great self learner, and he will get the job done, because he knows well how to search and learn new stuff.</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>While we were both student at CareerFoundry I had the pleasure to interact with Alexander on a frequent basis and to review his work.</p>
          <p>Although we were in separate courses, I often had the opportunity to review and comment on his web development work from my perspective as a former corporate web producer and now UX student.</p>
          <p>I’ve worked with many developers in the past and so have an extra appreciation for Alex’s impressive qualities and achievements.</p>
          <p>Alex is very dedicated to learning about and improving every detail of his coding efforts but also is a person that keeps an eye out on the bigger picture. He asks very good, insightful questions. In addition he was a great classmate offering help and advice to anyone that needed it, including those that don’t have a strong coding background. A fast learner by nature, Alex is very self motivated and willing to go the extra step. He takes input well and is never defensive, always seeking to improve himself.</p>
          <p>I think the fact that CareerFoundry selected Alex from among all their recent graduates as well as external candidates to become a Web Development mentor for them speaks volumes about both his skills and his character.</p> 
          <p>In summary, I would not hesitate to recommend Alexander for any development position in your organization.</p>

           <p>I have had the pleasure of viewing Alex's development over the 6 months, and I can state with confidence that he is a motivated and responsible person with a high degree of integrity.</p>
           <p>As his mentor, I feel that I know Alex quite well. He started working over extra projects since the early start of the course at Careerfoundry. In this period, he had a considerable amount of effort and talent shown in his work.<p>
           <p>He showed his passion about what he is doing my going the extra mile in every opportunity, and due to his dedication and attention to detail he completed the course with one of the best performance I've experienced since I started working as a mentor a year ago. Alex always do tremendous research before asking for guidance which is an essential skill for developers in general.</p>
